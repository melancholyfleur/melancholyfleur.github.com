        My name is Marylou Lenhart. <br />

        I am a professional software developer, currently working in RoR.  <br />
        I am involved in the Ruby community quite a bit, and I am an organizer of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/chapters/pittsburgh">GirlDevelopIt Pittsburgh</a>. 
        We have a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girl-develop-it-pittsburgh">Meetup page</a> if you want to get involved. <br />
        I was a speaker and coach at <a href="http://railsgirls.com/pittsburgh">Rails Girls Pittsburgh</a> in January 2013. 
        The slides from my presentation are <a href="/presentations/confidence/index.html">here</a>.<br />
        I have a blog <a href="http://www.blog.maryloulenhart.com">here</a>.  <br />
